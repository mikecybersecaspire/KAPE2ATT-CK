# KAPE2ATT&CK

## What is this project?

KAPE2ATT&CK is a repository of pre-built (Powershell) KAPE acquisition scripts, each mapped to the 12 Enterprise MITRE ATTACK Techniques. These scripts are only for Windows hosts, and only make use of the existing targets in KAPE.

The scripts support storing the collected artefacts locally, or in cloud. It's recommended you test these scripts in a controlled sandbox environment before adding to your production-ready forensics arsenal.

The artefacts acquired by these scripts are not exhaustive, I'd encourage anyone to fork the project or recommend changes/improvements ðŸ˜Ž

## Example Use Case
Typically, as DFIR analysts, we're tasked with investigating activity pertaining to a particular tactic i.e. You're a DFIR analyst, working as part of a wider team investigating a ransomware case, you may be tasked with investigating the exfiltration element. You might need a script just to collect the most important artefacts relating to identifying evidence of exfiltration.

## Requirements
* Powershell
* Some tools for modules

## Usage
This can be run locally via Powershell, or can be distributed at scale via an EDR agent of your choice. If you don't have access to a commercial EDR product, I'd recommend https://www.rapid7.com/products/velociraptor/ or https://limacharlie.io/

## Extending this project
You could scale the execution of these scripts by utilising an EDR-style agent, or a tool that allows you to run Powershell at scale; then utilise Log2Timeline/Timesketch to hunt for tactics at scale. https://github.com/google/timesketch
